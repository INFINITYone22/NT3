NT3 (Native Ternary Transformer Training) is a groundbreaking framework that trains transformer models directly in ternary precision {-1, 0, +1} from day one, eliminating the need for post-training quantization. This revolutionary approach achieves:

- **ðŸ”¥ 10Ã— Memory Reduction** during training
- **âš¡ 3Ã— Training Speedup** compared to FP16 baselines  
- **ðŸ“¦ 4Ã— Model Compression** with native ternary weights
- 
## âœ¨ Key Features

### ðŸŽ¯ Core Innovations
- **Native Ternary Training**: Direct training in {-1, 0, +1} precision from initialization
- **Gradient Accumulation Buffer**: Continuous optimization in discrete space using FP16 buffers
- **Hybrid Precision Strategy**: Ternary weights + FP8 attention + FP16 gradients
- **Deterministic Projection**: Stable weight quantization without stochastic noise
